# My personal website

Made as an evolution to this [bloated trainwreck](https://github.com/jeffreyfei/jeffreyfei.com-ver.-2-)
that I made in my freshman year when using AngularJS was still considered
legal.

My resume gets autobuilt and pushed here via Travis CI whenever an update is
made [here](https://github.com/jeffreyfei/resume)
