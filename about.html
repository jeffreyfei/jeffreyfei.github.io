            <h2>Jeffrey Fei; Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>
            I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor's Degree
            in Software Engineering.
            <br><br>
            I specialize in all sorts of automation, which includes
            distributed infrastructure, pipelines, containerization, dev tools
            etc. (aka 
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">none trivial art </a>
            of reducing day to day suffering for
            developers)
            <br><br>
            I also have a wide breadth of experiences and knowledge in other fields of software
            development such as bigdata infrastructure, databases,
            backend, frontend in descending order of enthusiasm from myself üòû.
            Despite my personal preferences, I believe having more tools in your
            toolbox can never be detrimental, and all of the above areas are
            of equal importance towards the know-how of a mature developer ü§ì.
